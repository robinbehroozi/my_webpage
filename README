This is the repository for my website that I currently have online at www.robinbehroozi.com. The website that I have online uses Zurb's Foundation framework, and from that site I create a Wordpress theme. I am simply showing the code that I used to make the mock up of the page, because apparently, Github doesn't allow for people to show their PHP code, which is fine. Thanks.
